| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Non-playing characters (NPC)  | Ghosts                                                       |
| Goal                          | Eat all the yellow dots without losing all your lives        |
| Rules                         | Pac-Man has 3 lives                                                                                          Pac-Man has to eat the yellow dots in the maze                                                                All four ghosts are patrolling the maze and the ghosts can eat Pac-Man     If Pac-Man eats the big dot, then he is able to eat the ghosts for a short period of time                                                                                                             Also when Pac-Man is in that stage, the ghosts that Pac-Man can eat will turn blue                                                                                                               Ghosts can be reborn after they are eaten and will not be blue                                  The game is won, once Pac-Man eats all the dots in the maze                                          The game is lost, if Pac-Man loses all its lives |
| Balance                       | Four ghosts patrolling vs. Power pellets' To which Pac-Man can eat the ghosts                                                                                                                          Maze corners where Pac-Man can hide |
| Adaptivity                    | It gets harder to eat the dots as the game progresses because there are lesser dots which are spread across the maze |
| Chance vs. Skill              | The movement of the ghosts are completely random so whether the Pac-Man gets detected by the ghosts or not has elements of chance involved. The skill of the player is in quickly maneuvering the Pac-Man away from the ghosts and eating all the yellow dots on the way |
| Feedback                      | Player gets points depending on how much dots or ghosts they eat. Player loses a life when is eaten by a Ghost.                                                      Sounds in the game give a quick feedback to the Player. |
| Story                         | Pac-Man wants to eat all the dots in the maze but the ghosts don't want him to eat them all so they try to stop Pac-Man from eating all the pellets. |
